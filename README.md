# Earthbound Misfit

This is my attempt at learning [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). 

> **Tongue tied and twisted, just an earthbound misfit, I** - Pink Floyd, Learning to Fly. 

## My Goals with this theme

1. It should look nice, I know this is a subjective thing, so you can judge me if you like.  
1. Be responsive, so it should look good and function whether you're viewing this on a phone, or a desktop/laptop.
1. Be SEO friendly. The output should get a 100 on [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) reports for SEO. 
1. The final output should also score highly on [Core Web Vitals](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?hl=en)
1. Have a layout for a gallery/portfolio that can be used easily. 


## Inspiration

The design/layout inspiration is from the Starter template that comes with [Bootstrap Examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/starter-template/)

The theme functionality/configuration ideas came from

1. [Vitae Theme](https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae)
1. [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/variables/page/#pages)
1. This site uses [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/) .. I'm not sure why I picked these over font-awesome.. I had never heard of these until a few weeks ago.. font-awesome is probably cached in everyone's browser so those may actually be faster. 

## Demo 

A demo of this site will be available at https://atestpage.com
